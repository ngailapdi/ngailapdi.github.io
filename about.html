<h1>Welcome to my personal website</h1>
<p align="justify">
	My name is Anh Thai, a 19-year-old Computer Science student at Georgia Institute of Technology. My threads (concentration) are Intelligence and Systems and Architecture.
</p>
<p align="justify">

	A little bit about my background: My major was Math when I was in high school. I first came to Tech as an undeclared engineering major in Fall 2015. After taking a CS class for engineering, I decided to declare my major as Computer Science. I officially became a CS student in Spring 2016.
</p>
<p align="justify">

	I am very interested in Algorithms and Data (AI, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, etc.) and also Software Engineering concepts. I do Math in my free time sometimes. I love music, drawing, swimming, martial arts, cooking, watching movies/series, talking and hanging out with my friends.
</p>
<p align="justify">

	Last but not least, my goal to create this website is to share and learn more about some of the things that I find interesting.
